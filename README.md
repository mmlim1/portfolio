# Technologies Used:

In making my portfolio, a Bootstrap card component was used to make asthetically pleasing cards for my tic tac toe project and future projects to fit inside. Thank goodness that Bootstrap exist!

Additionally I used Github to create a repository for my porfolio, Trello to make my plan board, Whimsical to make my wireframe, and VS Code to write my html, css, and javascript.

# Next Steps:

I plan to enhance my portfolio in the future by adding a dark mode feature. Additionaly, I plan to add sound to my portfolio.
